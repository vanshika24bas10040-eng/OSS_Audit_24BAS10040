## Project Overview
This repository contains the technical components for the **OSS Capstone Project**. It includes a series of Bash scripts designed to audit the Python environment on a Linux system, demonstrating the transparency, security, and accessibility of open-source tools. 

As a student specializing in **AI and Machine Learning**, this audit focuses on how the open-source nature of Python has enabled the rapid growth of the modern AI ecosystem.

## Included Scripts
The following scripts were developed to perform a deep-dive audit of the local environment:

1. **`1_system_identity.sh`**: Identifies the host operating system, kernel version, and associated OS licensing.
2. **`2_package_inspector.sh`**: Audits the presence of Python 3 and retrieves metadata regarding the specific build and versioning.
3. **`3_disk_auditor.sh`**: Analyzes the physical file footprint of Python within the `/usr/lib` directory to understand system-level integration.
4. **`4_log_analyzer.sh`**: Scans system logs (`/var/log/dpkg.log`) to track the history of Python-related installations and updates.
5. **`5_manifesto.sh`**: An interactive script that generates a personalized Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) manifesto.
